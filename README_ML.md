# üöÄ ML Model Integration Guide

## Overview
This application now includes integration with a Machine Learning model for career prediction based on quiz answers. The ML model analyzes user responses to 25 career interest questions and provides personalized career recommendations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Current Setup
- **Frontend**: React Quiz component that collects user answers
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API with ML prediction endpoint
- **ML Service**: Python Flask microservice running the actual ML model
- **Model**: `career_predictor_model.pkl` - Trained Random Forest classifier

### Data Flow
1. User completes the career interest quiz (25 questions)
2. Frontend sends answers to Node.js backend
3. Backend forwards request to Python ML service
4. ML service runs prediction using the trained model
5. Results are returned with course recommendations

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
cd edtech_project/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the ML Service
```bash
cd edtech_project/backend
python ml_service.py
```
The ML service will run on port 5001.

### 3. Start the Node.js Backend
```bash
cd edtech_project/backend
npm run dev
```
The backend will run on port 5000.

### 4. Start the React Frontend
```bash
cd edtech_project/frontend
npm start
```
The frontend will run on port 3001.

## üîß Configuration

### ML Service Configuration
- **Port**: 5001 (configurable in `ml_service.py`)
- **Model Path**: `ml_model/career_predictor_model.pkl`
- **Course Data**: `ml_model/course_suggestions_with_colleges.json`

### Backend Configuration
- **Port**: 5000 (configurable in `.env`)
- **ML Service URL**: `http://localhost:5001` (configurable in ML routes)

## üìä How It Works

### Quiz Questions
The quiz includes 25 questions covering:
- **Creative & Artistic**: Drawing, Dancing, Singing, Photography, Makeup, Designing
- **Logical & Scientific**: Puzzles, Coding, Electricity, Science, Chemistry, Physics
- **Technical & Mechanical**: Mechanics, Computer Parts, Engineering
- **Medical & Biological**: Doctor, Gardening, Biology, Chemistry
- **Business & Management**: Business, Management, Leadership, Communication
- **Social & Helping**: Helping Others, Teaching, Counseling, Social Work

### ML Prediction Process
1. **Feature Extraction**: Convert quiz answers to feature vector
2. **Model Prediction**: Use trained Random Forest classifier
3. **Course Matching**: Find courses that match user interests
4. **Recommendations**: Provide personalized career suggestions

### Output Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "prediction": {
    "predicted_course": "BBA- Bachelor of Business Administration",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "topFeatures": [["Business", 5], ["Management", 4], ...],
    "recommendedCourses": [...],
    "featureScores": {...},
    "message": "Based on your interests, we recommend: BBA..."
  }
}
```

## üéØ Features

### AI-Powered Recommendations
- **Personalized Suggestions**: Based on individual quiz responses
- **Course Matching**: Intelligent matching of interests to career paths
- **College Information**: Includes colleges in Kolhapur for each course
- **Salary Insights**: Expected salary ranges for different careers
- **Skill Requirements**: Skills needed for each career path

### User Experience
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant career predictions
- **Visual Results**: Beautiful, organized presentation of recommendations
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and smooth animations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ML Service Not Starting
```bash
# Check if Python dependencies are installed
pip list | grep flask

# Check if model file exists
ls -la ml_model/career_predictor_model.pkl
```

#### Model Loading Errors
```bash
# Verify model file integrity
python -c "import joblib; model = joblib.load('ml_model/career_predictor_model.pkl'); print('Model loaded successfully')"
```

#### Connection Issues
```bash
# Test ML service health
curl http://localhost:5001/health

# Test backend health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in the ML service by setting `debug=True` in `ml_service.py`.

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### For Production Use
1. **Use Production WSGI Server**: Gunicorn or uWSGI instead of Flask development server
2. **Environment Variables**: Configure ports and URLs via environment variables
3. **Load Balancing**: Consider multiple ML service instances for high traffic
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring for ML service performance
5. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and rate limiting

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
# Example Dockerfile for ML service
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5001
CMD ["python", "ml_service.py"]
```

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Model Retraining**: Automatic model updates with new data
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different recommendation algorithms
- **User Feedback**: Collect and use user feedback to improve predictions
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed insights into user career preferences
- **Integration**: Connect with external career databases and APIs

### Model Improvements
- **Feature Engineering**: Add more sophisticated feature extraction
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple ML models for better accuracy
- **Real-time Learning**: Update model based on user interactions
- **Personalization**: User-specific model fine-tuning

## üìû Support

For technical support or questions about the ML integration:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the console logs for error messages
3. Verify all services are running on correct ports
4. Ensure model files are properly copied to the backend directory

---

**Note**: This ML integration provides a foundation for intelligent career guidance. The accuracy of predictions depends on the quality of the trained model and the relevance of the training data.
